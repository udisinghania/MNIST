### Developed by Udit Singhania and Udit Singhania at VIT University Vellore

Personality is one of the most important defining source of a person as it depicts the oneâ€™s thinking, acting and interpreting ability towards outside its environment. Over the past years, different aspects of personality have been studied from different angles. With the development of technology, several studies aim to predict personality by analyzing patterns in ones behavior, pictures and even writing style. Furthermore, the increase of social media and increasing online communities make
personalized textual data increasingly available. In this project, we predict using 16 personality factor for the people based on their writing style. We develop a model that will map 16 personality factor based on the writing style of an individual.
